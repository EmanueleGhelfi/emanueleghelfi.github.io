**Work**: 

- **September 2020 - Present**: Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer at [Deep Vision Consulting]. 

- **November 2018 - September 2020**: Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer at [Zuru Tech Italy].
  I was involved in the following topics:
  - Anomaly detection
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to various problems
  - Computer Vision applied to industrial processes
  - Sequence Modeling through Recurrent Models (LSTM)
  - Machine Learning models deployment on Google Cloud Platform
  For all these tasks I covered the steps of solution design, algorithm implementation, algorithm evaluation, solution deployment.

**Education**: I finished my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano] in December 2018. In my thesis I developed a new Reinforcement Learning algorithm in order to optimize jointly the environment and the agent policy. The paper from my thesis has been accepted at ICML 2019. See more about my research in the [Portfolio][proj-research].
If your are interested, read the post about my thesis [here][thesis-post].
